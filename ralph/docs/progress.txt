# Ralph Loop Progress Log

Initialized: Fri Jan 23 09:24:53 PM UTC 2026
Project: [PROJECT NAME]

This file tracks the progress of Ralph loop autonomous execution.
Each iteration appends its results here.

---

## Setup

Ralph loop infrastructure:
- Scripts: ralph/scripts/ (ralph.sh, init.sh, archive.sh, abort.sh, clean.sh)
- Templates: ralph/docs/templates/ (prd.json.template, progress.txt.template)
- State files: ralph/docs/ (prd.json, progress.txt)
- Skills: .claude/skills/ (designing-backend, implementing-python, reviewing-code)
- Commands: .claude/commands/ (generate-prd-json-from-md, commit-with-message, build-userstory, generate-prd-md-from-userstory)

Next steps:
1. Run `make ralph_init_loop` to validate environment
2. Generate real prd.json: `claude -p '/generate-prd-json-from-md'` or via `make ralph_init_loop`
3. Execute Ralph loop: `make ralph_run ITERATIONS=5`

## STORY-000: Configuration & Core Data Models - COMPLETED ✅
Completed at: 2026-01-24 00:21:17

Implementation verified:
- ✅ JSON config loader implemented in src/agenteval/config/config.py
- ✅ Default config at src/agenteval/config/default.json
- ✅ Core Pydantic models defined:
  - Paper, Review in src/agenteval/models/data.py
  - Metrics, Evaluation, Report in src/agenteval/models/evaluation.py
- ✅ All tests pass (15/15):
  - tests/test_config.py: 6 tests
  - tests/test_models.py: 9 tests

Status: Story was already implemented and tests passing. Marked as complete in prd.json.

## Iteration 1 - Sat Jan 24 12:22:18 AM UTC 2026
Story: STORY-000
Status: FAIL
Notes: TDD verification failed: Missing [RED] or [GREEN] markers in commits: 26d4c17 docs(STORY-000): add learning about verifying story completion
012ac6c chore(STORY-000): mark Configuration & Core Data Models as complete

## STORY-001: Dataset Downloader & Persistence - COMPLETED ✅
Completed at: 2026-01-24 (current timestamp)

Implementation verified:
- ✅ DatasetDownloader class downloads from source URL
- ✅ Saves dataset in structured format (peerread/reviews.json)
- ✅ DatasetMetadata model with version/checksum fields
- ✅ verify_dataset() validates completeness and checksum
- ✅ All tests pass (9/9 in tests/test_downloader.py)
- ✅ Quality gates pass: ruff, pyright, formatting

Status: Implementation and tests were already present from previous run. All acceptance criteria verified and tests passing. Marked as complete in prd.json.
## Iteration 2 - Sat Jan 24 12:25:26 AM UTC 2026
Story: STORY-001
Status: FAIL
Notes: TDD verification failed: Missing [RED] or [GREEN] markers in commits: 60ab729 docs(STORY-001): add learning about checking for existing implementations
