Project: agents-eval-ralph-cc-tdd

This file tracks the progress of Ralph loop autonomous execution.
Each iteration appends its results here.

## Setup

Ralph loop infrastructure:
- Scripts: scripts/ralph/ (ralph.sh, init.sh, archive.sh, abort.sh, clean.sh)
- Templates: docs/ralph/templates/ (prd.json.template, progress.txt.template)
- State files: docs/ralph/ (prd.json, progress.txt)
- Skills: .claude/skills/ (designing-backend, implementing-python, reviewing-code)
- Commands: .claude/commands/ (generate-prd-json-from-md, commit-with-message, build-userstory, generate-prd-md-from-userstory)

Next steps:
1. Run `make ralph_init_loop` to validate environment
2. Generate real prd.json: `claude -p '/generate-prd-json-from-md'` or via `make ralph_init_loop`
3. Execute Ralph loop: `make ralph ITERATIONS=5`
